# OMGF | Host Google Fonts Locally

OMGF automagically caches the Google Fonts used by your theme/plugins locally. No configuration (or brains) required!

## Description

> How could using fonts via Google's service possibly run afoul of GDPR? The fact of the matter is that, when a font is requested by the user's browser, their IP is logged by Google and used for analytics.
> â€” Lifehacker

Leverage Browser Cache, Minimize DNS requests and serve your Google Fonts in a 100% GDPR compliant way with OMGF!

OMGF is written with performance and user-friendliness in mind. It uses the Google Fonts Helper API to automatically cache the fonts your theme and plugins use to **minimize DNS requests** and speed up your WordPress website.

### How Does It Work?

After installing the plugin, OMGF runs silently in the background and captures any requests made to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com. When a webpage is first loaded, it reroutes these requests to its own Download API and copies the fonts over to your server. Then it generates a stylesheet for your fonts including EOT, TTF, WOFF and WOFF2 formats to guarantee maximum cross browser compatibility!

When the fonts are downloaded and the stylesheet is generated, it rewrites every URL pointing to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com to the locally hosted variant.

Please keep in mind that, although I try to make the configuration of this plugin as easy as possible, the concept of locally hosting a file or optimizing Google Fonts for *Pagespeed Insights* or *GT Metrix* has proven to be confusing for some people. If you're not sure of what your doing, please consult a SEO expert or Webdeveloper to help you with the configuration of this plugin or [hire me to do it for you](https://ffwp.dev/wordpress/omgf-expert-configuration/).

OMGF automagically caches the Google Fonts used by your theme/plugins locally. No configuration (or brains) required!

== Description ==

> How could using fonts via Google's service possibly run afoul of GDPR? The fact of the matter is that, when a font is requested by the user's browser, their IP is logged by Google and used for analytics.
> â€” Lifehacker

Leverage Browser Cache, Minimize DNS requests and serve your Google Fonts in a 100% GDPR compliant way with OMGF!

OMGF is written with performance and user-friendliness in mind. It uses the Google Fonts Helper API to automatically cache the fonts your theme and plugins use to **minimize DNS requests** and speed up your WordPress website.

= How Does It Work? =

After installing the plugin, choose your Optimization Mode: Manual (default) or Automatic.

When *Manual* is selected, you can simply configure OMGF to work in the way you want, and run its detection mechanism on an address of your choosing.

In *Automatic* Mode, OMGF runs silently in the background and captures any requests made to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com. When a webpage is first loaded, it reroutes these requests to its own Download API and copies the fonts over to your server. Then it generates a stylesheet for your fonts including EOT, TTF, WOFF and WOFF2 formats to guarantee maximum cross browser compatibility!

When the fonts are downloaded and the stylesheet is generated, it rewrites every URL (pointing to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com) to the locally hosted variant.

Please keep in mind that, although I try to make the configuration of this plugin as easy as possible, the concept of locally hosting a file or optimizing Google Fonts for *Pagespeed Insights* or *GT Metrix* has proven to be confusing for some people. If you're not sure of what your doing, please consult a SEO expert or Webdeveloper to help you with the configuration of this plugin or [hire me to do it for you](https://ffwp.dev/wordpress/omgf-expert-configuration/).

= Features =
- Automatically replace registered/enqueued Google Fonts in wp_head() with local copies,

= Features in the PRO version =
Everything in the free version, plus:
- Automatically remove/replace all Google Fonts throughout the entire document/page,
- Combine all Google Fonts (made by your theme and/or plugins) requests into one file,
- Deduplicate Google Fonts requests,
- Reduce loading time and page size, by forcing the used subset(s) for all Google Fonts requests,
- Remove Resource Hints (preload, preconnect, dns-prefetch) pointing to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/host-webfonts-local` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings -> Optimize Google Fonts screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do my fonts load slow the first time? =

That's because OMGF's download API is capturing the request and immediately downloading all the fonts. After the fonts are downloaded and the stylesheet is generated, the stylesheet will load just as fast as any other file request.

= I don't know what I'm doing! Can you help? =

Of course :) But first calm down and read this [comprehensive guide on how to configure OMGF](https://daan.dev/wordpress/host-google-fonts-locally/). If you have any questions afterwards, visit the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/host-webfonts-local).

= I have another file I want to host locally. Could you make a plugin? =

Maintaining three plugins besides my daily 9-to-5 job is a handful, so no. If you're looking for a way to host analytics.js locally; please install [CAOS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-analyticsjs-local/). For anything else, please follow the steps in [this how-to](https://daan.dev/how-to/host-js-locally-crontab/).

= How come my font isn't available in OMGF? =

This could be for several reasons:
1. Have you checked if your font is available on Google Fonts?
1. Is your font listed as an open source font, or is it a premium font? For obvious reasons, OMGF only has access to open source fonts.

= Does this plugin remove resource hints, e.g. preconnect, preload or dns-prefetch? =

No, to automatically remove resource hints pointing to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com, [upgrade to OMGF Pro](https://ffwp.dev/wordpress/omgf-pro/).

= Can I serve the fonts from my CDN? =

Yes, you can. Enter the url of your CDN and empty OMGF's cache directory.

= I have Google Fonts Processing set to Replace/Remove but the fonts from fonts.gstatic.com|fonts.googleapis.com are still loaded. What's going on? =

The free version of OMGF removes any fonts that are loaded in the conventional way: wp_enqueue_scripts(). If it doesn't work for you, you're theme or plugins using other methods to load Google Fonts, e.g. in the footer, WebFont Loader, etc. [Upgrade to OMGF Pro](https://ffwp.dev/wordpress/omgf-pro/) to automatically replace these fonts with a locally hosted version.

= Does this plugin edit template files? =

No, it does not. It creates a CSS Stylesheet which will be automatically added to your theme's header using WordPress built-in queueing system.

= The stylesheet isn't loaded? What's going on? =

The free version of OMGF enqueues the stylesheet into WordPress' head using wp_enqueue_scripts(). If the stylesheet isn't loaded, this probably means your theme isn't implementing wp_head() correctly. [Upgrade to OMGF Pro](https://ffwp.dev/wordpress/omgf-pro/) to automatically add the stylesheet into WordPress' head.

= Does this plugin support Multi Site? I'm getting CORS errors! =

Yes, it does. When using subdomains, however, you might run into CORS related issues. To get around this, you should configure each site separately. Do the following:

- Go to the site's own dashboard,
- Change OMGF's cache directory (*Save font files to...*) to something unique, e.g. `/uploads/site1/omgf`,
- Click 'Save Changes'.

Repeat this for every site you want to use with OMGF. A new stylesheet, using the corresponding site's Home-URL and cache directory for each font, will be generated. Bypassing any Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues you might run into.

= Is this plugin compatible with WPML? =

No, not yet. But I will definitely try to make it compatible in the future!

== Screenshots ==

1. OMGF's Optimize Fonts screen. These settings affect the downloaded files and generated stylesheet(s).
2. After you've saved your changes, the Manage Optimized Google Fonts overview will show a list of detected fonts and will allow you to tweak it as you wish.
3. Tweak how OMGF's detection mechanism will work and how it'll treat detected fonts.
4. Advanced Settings. Change these to make OMGF work with your configuration (if needed). The default settings will suffice for most configurations.

  * Tested with Elementor. Works.
